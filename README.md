#### More Google Map functionality

Use google map listeners to do the following:

* When the center changes, get the new latlng and change the geolocation to display the new address
* Drop a pin on the center of the map
* Change a bunch of the logic in the `link` function to be inside a controller in the directive
  * Load this controller from a `controllers` folder in the directive
* Change the geolocation to a text input it so that:
  * If the map is moved manually, it changes the address in that text input to the center address
  * If the address is changed in the text input and submitted, it geocodes it and changes the center to the new location

### To continue:

* `git add .`
