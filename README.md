## Activity 16 - Notepad Directive

Let's create a new directive:

```
<notepad></notepad>
```

#### On your own

This directive should do the following:

* Display a div with the text: "Click here to edit"
* When the div is clicked, it should turn into a text editable div using the html5 tag `contenteditable`
* When the user hits enter, it should return back to a normal div
* Shift enter should be fine

Use the following as the template for your directive:

```
<div class="notepad">
  <h4>Notepad</h4>
  <div class="notepad-content">
    Click here to edit
  </div>
</div>
```

### To continue:

* `git add .`
* `git commit -m "my activity_16 completed work"`
* Activities no longer have completed code, proceed to Activity 16 while keeping your code.
