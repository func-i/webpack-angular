## Activity 5 - Adding a show route

You should be on the url `/posts`

We have a list of our posts, let's add a route to view a single post from our list.
You will be doing most of this exercise on your own.

#### Adding a show route

In `app/posts/routes.js` you can see the route for our `index` action.  Let's add the show route.

Add the following code to `app/posts/routes.js` below your `index` route.

``` javascript
.state('postsShow', {
  url: '/posts/:id',
  template: require('./views/show.html'),
  controller: 'postsShowController',
  controllerAs: 'showCtrl'
})
```

#### You're on your own.

You are missing: 

* A showController
  * That queries the API to load a single record.  
  * [ngResource](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource)
    * hint: `Post.get`
    * We need to make an API call with the `:id` of the post.
      If you notice in the template given below, we are passing that `id` into the `ui-sref` which is our router link
      We need a way to access URL params.
    * hint: inject `$stateParams` into your show controller. 
            console.log($stateParams) to see what's there.
* A show view template

As some help, here is a change to `app/posts/views/index.html`

```
<h1>Posts</h1>

<ul class='list-group'>
  <a class="list-group-item" ng-repeat="post in indexCtrl.posts" ui-sref="postsShow({id: post.id})">
    {{ post.title }}
  </li>
</ul>
```

### To continue:

* `git add .`
* `git commit -m "my activity_04 completed work"`
  * The code in the next step may be different than the code you wrote
